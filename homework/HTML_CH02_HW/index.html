<h1>My Hobby: Gaming</h1>
<img src="images/gamecontroller.png" alt="Game Controller" width="240" height="200">

<p>Gaming has been my favorite hobby for years now. It serves as an "escape" for me when I just don't want to deal with reality currently. I made tons of online frineds
  and made tons of memories via gaming. </p>
  <p>Personally, my favorite genres of video games are Survival, Strategy, and Shooter games. My favorite game out of the bunch is Destiny 2.
  Something about Destiny 2 just hit different, like it was multiple sci-fi stories all compressed into one.</p>
  <p>The lore is amazing as well!</p>
