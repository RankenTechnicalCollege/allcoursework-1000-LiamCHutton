      <p>My name is Liam Hutton. I'm a student at Ranken technical college studying Application and Web development.<br>
      I really like to play video games but I'm also pretty solitary when it comes to them, meaning I prefer to play alone. I also don't really<br>
      enjoy homework because of how annoying it can be to me, and how I have like no motivation to do any. I still do the homework anyways.<br>
      The quality of the results I provide on homework are dull sometimes. This is mostly because I have difficulty explaining what answer I'm thinking of.</p>
